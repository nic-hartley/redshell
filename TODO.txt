Tasks to work on in the future, in no particular order, but generally in order I plan to do them.

- Unit tests!!!!
- Build a convenient abstraction for text input
- CLI ctrl+c to kill current tool
- CLI ctrl+d to end current line
- Refactor tool running to let them do more advanced rendering/take input
- Write command line option parsing
- Get `ls` to show things based on arguments
- Make the CLI track its state for real
- `cd` command
- Tweak the colors to look nice c:
- Finish the intro cinematic
- GNU style options
- NPC system
- Refactor files to mimic real directories more
- Refactor machines, and tie CLI to machine rather than GameState
- Inter-machine networking (keep it high level! machines as agents?)
- Thread pool or rayon or something for agent/event processing
- WASM/web IoSystem
- Webserver + JS frontend IoSystem?
