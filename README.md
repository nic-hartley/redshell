# Redshell

Redshell is a semi-procedural text-based cyberpunk game about hacking.
Inspired by real-world offensive security tools, and fully capable of being played over SSH as well as on a typical GUI, it's a game by devs for devs.
You can play offline singleplayer forever, or join your friends with realtime multiplayer, even if you can't connect to the internet.

But that's about as far as it can be explained without risking spoilers.
If you're ready to play, [download an installer](https://github.com/nic-hartley/redshell/releases/latest) and launch the Redshell.

If you want to support development, [there are several ways].
