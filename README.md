# Redshell

For now, this is a half-built engine and some 'concept art'.
You can try it out by installing from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install redshell
redshell-concept
```

Or you can install it from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nic-hartley/redshell.git
cd redshell
cargo install --path .
redshell-concept
```

Once installed, you'll have a `redshell` binary, which for now does nothing, and a `redshell-concept` binary, which will let you run miscellaneous tech demos that I've very generously called 'concept art'.
